# /boot

This partition consists of the Android kernel and the ramdisk. Basically, every single thing 
that is needed to boot your Android device when powered on. You should only proceed to wipe 
this partition from recovery if it is absolutely necessary. If you do, once the partition is 
wiped, ensure to reboot the phone only after installing a new boot partition. The new 
partition can be a /boot partition found in a ROM.

# /system

The system partition accommodates the entire Android OS. This includes the Android GUI as well 
as the system apps that come pre-installed on Android devices. So, what happens if you wipe 
this partition? Well, you can still boot the device. We will only be able to put our device 
into recovery or bootloader mode.

# /recovery

This partition is designed for backup and can be considered the alternative boot option or 
partition in an Android device. It lets the device boot into recovery mode, where backing up 
data, wiping data, restoring the phone to factory settings, and performing other maintenance 
operations.

# /data

Also known as user data partition, this partition consists of all of the user’s data, including 
contacts, settings, apps, and messages. Wiping the data partition will lead to storing your 
phone in factory settings, having removed all of the apps, messages, and user settings from 
the Android device.

# /cache

This partition stores the frequently accessed app data and components. Wiping this partition 
will clear the built-up cache, and the device will simply go back to rebuilding it as you 
continue using it. Clearing the cache also frees up some space in your device and can also fix 
certain issues at times.

# /misc

This partition contains all the miscellaneous system settings, usually on/off switches. The 
settings may include carrier or region ID, USB configuration, and certain hardware settings. 
This partition is very important since it can cause several device features to malfunction if 
the partition becomes corrupt or goes missing. A missing /misc partition can also cause the 
Android device not to boot at all.

# /sdcard

This partition is the space that is available to users to store their files and data. Depending 
on your device, you could have more than one sdcard partition. If your device has an external 
SD card slot, then the /sdcard partition refers to the internal storage device, and the external 
SD card will be assigned a different partition, either a new partition called /sdcard2 or a 
separate directory within the /sdcard partition itself such as /sdcard/sd. Wiping the partition 
with the external SID card storage is completely safe as long as you have backed up any important 
data or documents you may have on it. Wiping the /sdcard partition with the external SD and 
storage is completely safe, as long as you have backed up any important data or documents you may 
have on it. Wiping the /sdcard partition, however, results in wiping some system and app data and 
settings, but it still doesn’t hinder the system’s boot processor functionality.

# /sd-ext

This is an additional partition of the sdcard partition, which is only present on some devices, 
typically ones that have custom ROMS or mods on them. It can usually be used with certain ROMS 
that have special features such as APP2SD+ or data2ext enabled. This is essentially a /data 
partition of the /sdcard and stores some user data and settings that are typically stored on the 
/data partition. This is useful for devices with limited internal memory.
