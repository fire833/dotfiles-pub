1. In case the wireless interface is already connected to some other AP, first disconnect it using

# nmcli con down <AP name>

Example: Supposing interface is already connected to 'PreviousAP', then disconnect it using

# nmcli con down PreviousAP

2. Now for Connecting to new AP

Considering you know the AP name and password.

# nmcli device wifi connect <AP name> password <password>

Example: AP name: Connect-to-this. WPA/WPA2 PSK: iampassword123

# nmcli device wifi connect Connect-to-this password iampassword123

If you don't want to have the wireless password stored in your history in recent versions you can add --ask to have nmcli prompt you for missing information it needs (default behavior if password is not provided).

This will automatically create a file in /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/ with the AP name, which will contain the configuration.

# ls /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/Connect-to-this

# Scan for wifi connections (I have a script in bashrc for this)
wificheck <device>
