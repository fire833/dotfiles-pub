# In 1.25, PodSecurityPolicies were removed. The replacement is Pod Security Admission.

In summary, the available default policies are the following:

* Privileged - Unrestricted policy, providing the widest possible level of permissions. This policy allows for known privilege escalations.
* Baseline - Minimally restrictive policy which prevents known privilege escalations. Allows the default (minimally specified) Pod configuration.
* Restricted - Heavily restricted policy, following current Pod hardening best practices.

You can specify at the cluster or namespace level which of the policies to enforce with the following labels:

* pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce: <LEVEL> - Policy violations will cause the pod to be rejected.
* pod-security.kubernetes.io/audit: <LEVEL> - Policy violations will trigger the addition of an audit annotation to the event recorded in the audit log, but are otherwise allowed.
* pod-security.kubernetes.io/warn: <LEVEL> - Policy violations will trigger a user-facing warning, but are otherwise allowed.
